A 80s style game inspired by flappy bird and subway surfers

This game I’m working on in my free time with a friend of mine and is still being worked but the game is basically about you controlling a DeLorean with wings and you have to move over and back with your fingers and get through obstacles without hitting them and increase your score and as the game progresses the speed of the obstacles come at you faster gradually. The game is heavily inspired by the likes of Flappy Bird and Subway Surfers but with my touch to it by adding 1980s themed art style where you are in space and trying to avoid neon light bars and asteroids. Currently this game is only being developed on Android devices and I’m currently just messing around with seeing what works and doesn’t work with the difficulty of the game
